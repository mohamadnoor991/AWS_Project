# AWS_Project


This project will give you an example of how you can use python3-boto3 to work with AWS.

This project is to create applications using AWS cloud  technology and interact with it. Therefore, there will be 2 applications one for calculation process and the other for image process.
###          Our team contains 5 members:

# Requirement for the first project:

- Install python3 on the AWS instance.
- Import boto3 library to the paython3 on AWS instance.
* To doing that you can follow the instruction in the video on this link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcFB5kYrjoI&list=PLylErWCb-ka4xKS6rLMXvBQ7MGLbxrWGk&index=14

*In the first two, you will find two python files, one for the client part and one for the server part, log file, and in the end the video-demo and word file (report). This report will explain the mechanism of the project and how you will execute it.*




***
# Requirement for the second project:

- Install python3 on the AWS instance.
- You will need to install the requirment file.
 
```sh
$ pip3 install requirements.txt -y
```
*In the second you can find 3 python files, one for the processing algorithm, one for the client, and one for the server(EC2). Will find also the image that used, the video-demo, and the report that will explain the mechanism of the project and how you will execute it.*
